# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
Being experimental and trying to work through problems via trial and error based on what I've learned so far. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Since methods are packages of instructions, this allows for the user to utilize these packages to shortcut past certain problems without needing to input a large volume of code everytime.
